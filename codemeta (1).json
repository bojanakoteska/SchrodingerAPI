    "description": "This RESTful web service (SchrodingerAPI) provides a method for solution of one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation based on the the Gauss-Hermite Discrete Variable Representation (DVR) approach.\n\nThe solution of one-dimensional (1D) Schrödinger equation is illustrated in the case of following model potentials:\n\nMorse potential;\nSimple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO) potential;\nSombrero potential (Mexican hat);\nWoods-Saxon potential.\nSolutions of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Schrödinger equations are illustrated for the following two model potentials: multidimensional Morse potential and multidimensional SHO potential.\n\n",
